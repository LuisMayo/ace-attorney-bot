This is a fork of a wonderful [Reddit bot](https://github.com/micah5/ace-attorney-reddit-bot)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

 - Python 3
 - Ace Attorney data. Download it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jNpnB3pjHFvOyrfZ-WxlOXNaZ-XH4INx?usp=sharing) and put them in `./assets/`
 - FFMPEG instalation. In most Linux distros it should be available in the default package manager, although it may have some caveats (more info on faq.md). In Windows systems it'd include downloading a [pre-compiled zip folder](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows), extracting it and adding the /bin folder into the [system path](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)

#### Optional
 - [Google Translation API Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup): These are needed for language support other than English. Other languages may work even without this credentials as the system will fallback to TextBlob's translation system.
